<p>Flowers not only add <em>color, texture,</em> and <em>biodiversity</em> to gardens and environments, they are also an
    important structure for plants and an essential food source for many organisms. Flowers are an important means of
    attracting pollen substances to plants, and plants need to produce seeds, the reproductive structures that allow
    seeds to exist for generations. Flowers can also protect growing seeds and successfully pass genetic material to the
    next generation. Flowering plants are called <strong>angiosperms</strong> and are a group that has evolved to
    include a variety of <em>sizes, shapes,</em> and <em>colours</em>.</p>
